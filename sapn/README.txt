Instruction to manually download electricity usage data from SA Power Network in NEM12 format.

1. Find an old electricity bill, note the NMI number (~11 digit), and any meter number (~9 digit).

2. Go to power SA login page, register using an email address.
https://www.sapowernetworks.com.au/your-power/manage-your-power-use/your-meter-data/
Probably best to use an email you use for spam, and a fake phone number.
When confirming the email address check your spam folder.

3. Finish the registration process using the NMI number and meter number.

4. Login to SA power dashboard
https://customer.portal.sapowernetworks.com.au/meterdata/apex/cadenergydashboard

5. Click "Download Data", under the plot, and choose "Detailed Report (CSV)".
