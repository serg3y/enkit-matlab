Hello, Can I get your 2c..

I like to experiment with different data visualisations.
This one is for visualising usage data, in this case NEM12 data from SAPN.
This is an interactive plot that lets a user zoom, pan and click to read of values.
I know its busy, but it can also convey a lot of information.

This data is from someone who has solar only and no battery.
First plot shows each of the meters separately.
Second plot sums all the meters to show just the Total.
Adding a battery makes the plot more chaotic.

I am interested in your comments:
Does the plot make since without explanation?
Would you change anything: layout, colour, labels?
Do you prefer the 'Buy', 'Sell', 'CL' version or the 'Total' one?
Would you like to see your usage data on such a plot?
Any particular questions you would try to answer with such a plot?
If this was a tool would you prefer an offline python file, or online webpage?
Would you be content seeing just your imports export data (using SAPN) or would you want to see further break down: house consumption, solar production, battery (using logs from your battery).
(Both options would require the user to manually acquire and provide their data to the tool.)
