Today I was surprised to learn that my Mum could have saved $450 to $790 over the last year on electricity bills if I had switched her from Energy Australia to Amber, even though she does NOT have solar and battery!

I have heard many times that Amber is mostly for people with batteries, and I had long suspected that there must be many exceptions of where you would be better off on wholesale prices even without a battery. I did not expect to find my own Mum's bills would show it and that the difference would be so big...

The key reasons for why the difference is so big are:
1) Mum is retired and most of her usage is during the day when wholesale prices are very cheap.
2) Mum is retired so her energy company has put her on the worst tariffs they could find. :(
3) There are some easy optimisations we can do to make the most of cheap day time prices.

To crunch the the numbers I got Mum's last bill and analysed her smart meter data using a program I am making.
- My Mum paid $1950 over the last 365 days (before Federal Government rebates and SA Government concession).
- Her current plan with Energy Australia is just awful. She is paying 52 c/kWh at all times.
- She uses most of the power during the day, when wholesale prices are very cheap, so with Amber she would be paying about 10 c/kWh.
- I crunched the numbers, factored in supply charges and Amber fees, and if I had switched her to Amber 365 days ago she would have saved  $450 without changing anything else.
- Further more if we had done some optimisations she would have saved even more... If I adjusted her hot water system to prioritise day time heating, asked her to turn of AC when she gets an SMS about the occasional price spike, and asked her to shift some of her usage away from morning and evening, then she probably would have saved another $340 per year. This amount is hard to estimate, its based partly on guess work and partly data analysis. I put some details in the report.

In total she could have saved about $790, plus another $120 for a one off referral I could give her.
I feel like a fool for not checking sooner.

I am attaching a short report of the analysis I did and some plots from my program, showing her usage data and costs for each 5 minute block with Energy Australia and with Amber.

I am also attaching all the data in case anyone wants to double check my numbers, in case I made a mistake. To verify the code I have used Mums meter data and simulated one of her Energy Australia bills and also used my own data and simulated one of my own bills. Both tests checked out to within a dollar.
