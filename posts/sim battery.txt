"Should I get a battery? What size? How much will it reduce my bills?"

These are the usual questions people ask, and the usual answer is — “it depends”
There are many variables: PV size, your usage patterns, and your electricity prices.

I can now calculate some hard numbers based on individual circumstance.
To predict the dollar value, I take historic usage data — preferably a year’s worth (in SA, this can be downloaded from SAPN) — along with their electricity prices (from the last bill). Then I simulate various battery sizes, e.g. 0–40 kWh, predict new imports and exports, and calculate the yearly savings.

Below you’ll find the simulated results for two scenarios.
It’s interesting to see (a) how large the potential savings are, and (b) how quickly and at what point they level off as the battery size increases.
There appears to be a clear sweet spot in each scenario if you’re purely after return on investment and not future-proofing.
Also provided are the detailed simulation results for Scenario 2 with a 10 kWh battery, showing daily averages and time-of-day averages.

Scenario 1: 3.0 kW solar — daily average imports/exports = 4.88 kWh / 6.46 kWh
Scenario 2: 6.6 kW solar — daily average imports/exports = 7.87 kWh / 24.07 kWh

If you’re in SA and wish to be my guinea pig, message me your SA Power Networks (SAPN) usage data and electricity prices from your last bill.

*** WARNING ***
SAPN data and bills contain personal information. The data includes your NMI number, and your bill contains even more details.
You can replace your NMI in the data file and only send me the part of the bill that shows your prices and time ranges.
However, your data can, in theory, reveal when you’re typically not home — which cannot be obscured.
I do not intend to distribute the data, but I may share the results.
In future, I hope to make this a stand-alone tool that people can run themselves.
*** WARNING ***

Instruction to manually download electricity usage data from SA Power Network in NEM12 format.
1. Find an old electricity bill, note the NMI number (~11 digit), and any meter number (~9 digit).
2. Go to power SA login page, register using an email address.
https://www.sapowernetworks.com.au/your-power/manage-your-power-use/your-meter-data/
Best to use an email you use for spam, and a fake phone number.
When confirming the email address check your spam folder.
3. Finish the registration process using the NMI number and meter number.
4. Login to SA power dashboard
https://customer.portal.sapowernetworks.com.au/meterdata/apex/cadenergydashboard
5. Click "Download Data", under the plot, and choose "Detailed Report (CSV)".
